For the past hundreds of years noone was able to go through the Dungeon of Doom and Death. Lot of warriors, wizards, and weird little gnomes tried the challenge, but none returned. Since you were a child you always wanted to be the true champion. You trained, learned and got equipment for this day, and now you're after all those times, you're ready to face whatever comes. The village threw a huge party last night for you, but you didn't attend it saying you'll have your slice of party when you return. But that was yesterday, now... you've descended to the darkness and ready to face the adventure of your life.
